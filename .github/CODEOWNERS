# This is a CODEOWNERS file.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# These patterns follow the same rules as .gitignore.
#
# Owners can be:
# - A GitHub username (e.g., @octocat)
# - A GitHub team name (e.g., @my-org/my-team)
# - An email address (e.g., user@example.com)
#
# Order matters: the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
#
# Example:
# *       @global-owner1 @global-owner2  # All files are owned by these users/teams
# *.js    @js-owner                      # .js files are owned by @js-owner
# /docs/  docs@example.com               # Files in the /docs/ directory are owned by docs@example.com

# All files in the repository are owned by nightconcept
* @nightconcept dark@nightconcept.net

# You can add more specific rules below if needed.
# For example, if different parts of the project have different owners:
#
# /cmd/      @nightconcept
# /internal/ @nightconcept
# /scripts/  dark@nightconcept.net
